Review of whitepapers, âPreservation by Alison Walkerâ plus ârequirements analysisâ - texts to review published by patents and standards board â EPO.

There are many software tools to support students in writing a thesis and scholarly literature in general.

Academic search engines and databases such as Google Scholar and CiteSeer help in finding relevant literature, plus PDF readers - annotating, bookmarking Adobe Acrobat and Foxit Reader electronic versions of academic articles.

Mind mapping tools such as MindManager and SciPlore MindMapping assist in managing ideas, literature and drafting the thesis. Word processors such as Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org assist in writing the thesis.Tools such as RefWorks or LaTeX and BibTex handle both formatting and reference lists, they allow for the user to concentrate on content over style. Finally, reference managers such as Mendeley, Zotero and JabRef automatically create reference lists often based on BibTeX.

Posing ontological research into their influence, presented as evaluative analysis â summarizing sense, experience & positive verification. Giving direction to enquiry, understanding that ontology requires dissection of reality into variables then represented through theoretical constructs underlying observable phenomena.

Results
Feasibility study, following a brief refresher on general programming idioms, re-reviewing the fundamentals of primitive data types, statements, arrays, static methods, input / outputs and data abstraction

Immediate refreshers; Data structure, abstract data type, interface, subtyping, template, type constructors, parametric polymorphism, encapsulation, polymorphic recursion, public / private interface and class, sub-type polymorphism and principles plus relevance to future study of Fast â Fourier Transformations or other types of algorithm.

Plus future subjects;

Single, Multiple, Hierarchical Multi-level and Hybrid Inherietance â plus Subtype polymorphism; templates (generics), member / operatorâs, overloading and coercion.

Subroutines, tail recursions, inheritance, pollymorphism and object instantiation. Mutated functions, higher order and first-class functions.
