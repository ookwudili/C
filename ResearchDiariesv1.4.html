There are many software tools to support students in writing a thesis and scholarly literature in general.<br />

Academic search engines and databases such as Google Scholar and CiteSeer help in finding relevant literature, plus PDF readers - annotating, bookmarking Adobe Acrobat and Foxit Reader electronic versions of academic articles.<br />

Mind mapping tools such as MindManager and SciPlore MindMapping assist in managing ideas, literature and drafting the thesis. Word processors such as Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org assist in writing the thesis.Tools such as RefWorks or LaTeX and BibTex handle both formatting and reference lists, they allow for the user to concentrate on content over style. Finally, reference managers such as Mendeley, Zotero and JabRef automatically create reference lists often based on BibTeX.</p>

<q>Although HTML5 has been well known among web developers for years, its interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media around April 2010[11][12][13][14] after Apple Inc's then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win".[15] This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5 provides enhanced functionality, developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash.[16] In early November 2011, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5</q><br />
