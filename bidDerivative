Abstract
--------




"..Genre is largely a matter of defining what kind of copy does and does not qualify as what you or your market sector is searching for. A researcher may wish to look only at certain subgenres such as 'spot' news, features or headlines, or at certain topics such as industrial, economic or international news, or take only the front page. Defining what stories are about a particular topic provides its own set of questions.."



Based on theory, not too dissimilar to essay questions or topic statements themselves a requirement to deliver on solid evidence; that revenue exists to be made from each venture based on the observation or dialogue of the communicator. It is to be proven through valid research, that trade warrants proportional representation through advertising or rather advertising fuels trade in equal proportion - should be considered part of a strategic delivery for marketing campaigns. 



Whether pitching or bidding for a window in the market, use of language markers are part and parcel of preparation which define active subject, inform strategies and offer directives as to opportunities and a base from which to develop frameworks for trade which would be of advantage to either party. With this regard, the development is built on existing frameworks / api's hosted by established vendors ebay, amazon plus many others.



Focus remains on the synthesis of ideas in communication, through joined up thinking which form convincing messages based on statistical data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Illustrated in the following extract from a larger project along the same lines;



'..According to the Government’s most recent Communications Plan, which outlined the budget for 2013 / 2014, the closure of the COI and the spending freeze on all unnecessary marketing activities implemented across the public sector has so far resulted in efficiencies of £40m since the last General Election. The Plan also stated that spending on communications would remain much lower than it was in 2009/2010 — when it stood at £532m — with the total marketing budget for 2013/2014 estimated at £236.9m. In addition, the Government revealed that it had tasked its procurement service with a review and revision of all existing communication procurement frameworks, which will be designed to provide support, guidance and tools to the new communications hubs regarding the procurement process..'

The new frameworks will provide a number of benefits to the interior Government..

"

Which puts forward figures for the past few years, stating revision of all existing communication procurement frameworks designed to provide for 'new communications hubs' incorporated in this process.



'..the accord is the delivery of interval answers to integral questions..'


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Strategy

Much the same as recent replacement of the nine frameworks used in government procurement, the central management spend for companies offering this franchise is to be reduced, which in turn is expected to deliver individual advantage to re-sellers - who may wish to customise their trading experience.

 A reduced supply base, which aims to cut overheads and minimise storage / transit costs is expected to make it easier for communication ‘hubs’ to work strategically with suppliers, who will now be managed in intervals - making clear revenue based on product trends for that quarter.



Although this abstract is not directly relevant to the project at large, the interpretation of the text forms the basic foundation from which to highlight aspects of the 'standard pricing model' introduced to support regular benchmarking and delivery of continuous project improvements which offer value for money throughout the trading term. Despite the efficiencies made within communication budgets, the reduction in marketing budgets across the public sector has without a doubt had a negative impact.

(*) { 14 of the 27 suppliers are small-to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which is directly in line with the Government’s wider ambitions to support the SME sector. 

Comprehensive management information will be collected every month under the new framework, to ensure greater transparency regarding what services the Government is procuring and to help identify future savings opportunities.

Description
-----------





The proposal is to adopt an Agile project framework, which analyses essential components including; concept, planning, prototyping and development around product and sector requirements.



Each applying:



- skills and application of concrete experiences

-- distinguished terms:
competition on price, speed, quality and correlation using purchase, trade histories, income, requirement - in particular, how product / service is to be molded and delivered by you to others, by others to you or improved upon by the supplier.



- aptitude as to what economic and statistical information to source*

-- trend data



- supply turnaround, observing fiscal trends

-- emerging micro / macro markets, their supply and demand


Markets



-------

"..Analysing audience and goal, especially helpful in creating business roadmap. The objective might be to raise capital, therefore asking yourself what readers, investors demand to know; your overall plan should answer those questions in part..”






Claims
------

a. { "..Turn-of-mouth return patterns are constantly subject to change because they depend on highly variable market microstructure..as consumers obtain more of a good they obtain less utility from each extra unit of the good. The effect is the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that for each extra, or marginal unit consumed of a good - gives utility that diminishes or falls compared with the previous unit. Consumers total utility is still increasing, as each marginal unit gives the consumer extra utility, at a slower pace with each extra unit. This pattern of diminishing marginal utility only applies over a fixed period of time. On another day or week, the consumer could once again experience the higher marginal utility." }

-------------------------------------------------------- reference -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merit goods
-----------

Merit goods are those for which consumer demand does not fully reflect consumer benefits. The market will undersupply merit goods either because those who would benefit from them will now realize this or, if they do, their demand would be ineffective. Education is often cited as an example of a merit good. In all countries, governments do not allow the market alone to provide education. They fear that children would not receive enough education because they, and their parents, might underestimate its benefits. Market demand would not reflect 'MSB - Marginal Private Benefit'. Instead, governments step in to require children consume education up to a certain age..

*under-supply which enables better quantification of sector demand..

Market regulation, and the introduction of 'demerit goods' the over consumption of which may not be good for them..

-------------------------------------------------------- reference -------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Justification for guiding consumerists;

Some economists have a problem with the idea of merit and demerit goods. It suggests that consumers do not know what is good for them. Economic market theory assumes that consumers do know this and are rational in wanting to maximize the utility they obtain from consuming goods. Suggesting that consumers do not know what is best for them undermines this principle.

It is said to be difficult to decide what merits - merit goods. The danger is that any good can be described as a merit good..a case could be made that merit goods remain an under supplied, re-orderable subsidie dictated by demand guided by market conditions. Part and parcel of regulation in a bid to avoid over provision, monitoring adverse selection in key sectors which underpin an infrastructure - education, work and healthcare.

-------------------------------------------------------- reference -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asymmetric Information
----------------------

This market failure arises if either consumers or producers have unequal, or asymmetric, information about the market. The market will fail as information is no longer perfect and those with extra information can exploit their advantage. Markets where consumers often know more than producers are those for insurance. When a consumer buys travel insurance, he or she knows how careful they will be when travelling and so the risk they represent to the insurance company. The company does not have this information. To offset the potential costs involved from not knowing, the insurance company charge all consumers more than if they had perfect information. Those consumers who know they are low risk and so likely to claim on the insurance policy now leave the market. The company is left insuring travellers who are relatively high risk while low-risk consumers have no insurance even though they would buy it at a lower price. The market fails because of adverse selection: only high-risk consumers are insured.

> Reference; Market failure and the cost of correcting for asymmetric information


Producers and consumers
-----------------------

Producers are also likely to know more than consumers in the health care market. It is normal practice that doctors (the producers) tell patients (the consumers) what is wrong and identify the treatment they require. But this undermines consumer sovereignty. No longer do consumers make choices that reflect their own preferences. Instead, producers determine demand.

This should present no problem if the wishes of the consumer are actively / accurately reflected by the producer - moreover how preferences of the shopper could better be turned into actionable returns for either reseller products or new brands.

Under existing circumstances, consumers do not have the information to make choices that reflect their own utility while producers exploit the asymmetry of information..

The initial idea focuses on change marketing, guiding the market on the acquisition of products. Informing them as to when is a good time to sell, bid or swap goods* - their market worth and the receptiveness of stockists, auditors, distributers. Moreover, as to which industry sectors will be buying based on the outlook of local economies - with the objective of presenting information in the interest of the buying public.

..competition and natural monopoly:

A special case of monopoly is natural monopoly in which the marginal cost of production is always falling. This occurs in utility industries such as gas, electricity and water that require large investments into their infrastructure - piping, cables etc. In order to supply the product to consumers. The fixed cost involved in setting up the industry are high - although once the network is in place, the marginal cost of supplying the product becomes progressively lower.

..market structure which can differ from economist's ideal of perfect competition. Markets with monopolistic competition, oligopoly, or monopoly generate outputs below that in perfect competition. As output in a perfect market is Pareto-efficient, imperfect competition is likely to lead to market failure. It is possible firms will produce the perfectly competitive output, only if they are not profit-maximizers..

note: slashing the cost of putting in place industries, including the steady reduction in marginal costs of supply and/or consumption, demand and supply (the later normally used for second-hand goods). The cost of establising the network is also a barrier to entry for new firms. They face high costs that they would have to recoup and would find it difficult to compete on price with existing firms. The problems for new entrants mean the monopoly is likely to persist. In cases such as this, one producer is enough and so the monopoly is 'natural'. In these monopolies the competition is only in supplying customers, this could further be divided into the supply of materials / re-packing and presentation of reseller goods this is just one way differences in administration costs, can make competition valuable.

'..Public provision of health and education can address market failures due to external benefits and can help to counter possible consequences of asymmetric information, as in health care. Governments also provide directly public goods such as defence, police and the coastguard, and quasi-public goods like roads..'

Public provision does not mean, however, that it has to be produced by the public sector. The use of tax revenue to pay private for production of goods is normally a provision saved for use by government departments. 

They use tax revenue to pay private producers to produce the goods, the suggestion here is that they also pay provision to resellers. 

- income inequality, a case for government intervention;

Sourcing competition in deregulated markets is key to the continued success of producers. Whether this information is re-factored as market research, the benefits which these markets bring in the form of new products, increased efficiency etc. may still be regarded. Self -interests of organisations and capacity of protecting own shareholders and equity in firms - critical functions which defines how that sector works.

Public provision does not mean, however, that it has to be produced by the public sector. The government can use tax revenue to pay private producers to produce the goods. The government can use tax revenue to pay private producers to produce the goods.

The government sets the framework and ensures a good is free to users, even though the provider is a private sector firm. They do this because a private firm, with profits in mind, has an incentive to be efficient. In contrast, a public provider with no profit motive can suffer from X-inefficiency. 

'..macroeconomic ideas have caused economists to emphasize the government's role in ensuring an economy's stability. This view matches the focus, which pointed to how a government can involve itself in individual markets to improve how they operate..' 

Reaching states of equilibrium, where the flow remains at a particular income and rate of expenditure - as when an individual market is in equilibrium when supply equals demand and there exists additional trade off's of the old economy. In addition there should be two major conditions of remaining in equilibrium at a fixed income rules / conditions of change inclusive to demand.

The adverse effects of savings can be offset as spending enters a circular flow elsewhere. In the simple economy, this happens when firms devote some of their spending to the goods of other firms and not the factor services of sectors. This happens when they buy capital goods. Predicting the circular flow, from what remains at a particular income or level of purchasing power.

Income and wealth
-----------------

Unlike income, wealth is rarely measured. The practical difficulties of measuring the value of every asset in an economy at a given date are immense and would be attempted in the knowledge that the very next day the value would have changed.

'..the economy maintains a constant income and is in equilibrium when savings (the withdrawal) equal investment (the injection). The downward effect savings can have on income is offset by the injection of extra income into the circular flow when firms invest. This economy can remain in equilibrium as long as savings and investment remain unchanged..'

Although the application protocol is just a component of a system of bids, the proposal is they remain subject to change dictated by the economic sponsors. An ideal which might better endorse both past and future marketable products.

{..Captializing on Rare Events..in particular activity quantifying markets, especially uncertainty in tracking the difference between actual and implied volatility; deemed to be strong enough in order to prompt introduction of products that allow investors to buy and sell realized volatility over a set timeframe. The intention is to track arbitrage trading strategies, betting on hypothetical evaluations and differences between the two - encouraging the introduction of indicators highlighted participants; dynamics which aim to show the match between product, resale and consumption - calculated to a window of time (delta).**

Choosing mini-options with what are said to be 'high deltas' which account for changes in the market. Changes such as discounting on product price, condition, term of use and closing of deals and manner in which it was agreed - the division between this for long and short-term traders. Using as a guide 'in-the-money' trade - delivering promises on profit, and that of 'short-term' investors overpaying for short-term positions.

- dynamics which create noise, in the form of rising and falling volatility. Adverse to the option that 'in-the-money' long-term traders have more insight as to market trends.

- noting 'out-of-the-money' options are said to ignore the changes in underlying stock, on a macro scale this may be an indicator of consumer dis-satisfaction.

- options markets often responds to news and events that have not yet unsurfaced at retail investor level by pricing in corrections several minutes before they occur. If the income effect exceeds the substitution effect a higher price causes demand to rise, as happens with Giffen goods, which are particular types of inferior goods.


1. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Economists use elasticity to identify how much demand responds to changes in any of the factors that explain demand. Large changes are elastic. Demand changes readily. Small changes are inelastic just as steel wires respond little when pulled. Factors of elasticity, identified include how much demand responds to change in any of the factors. As price and quantity demanded are both elements in the PED formula, a firm can establish how changing the price of its good affects revenue if it knows the PED of its goods.

For example, when demand is price-inelastic, increasing price cuts demand, but the fall is less in percentage terms than the price rise. Mathematically, revenue must rise. If demand is elastic, though, and the firm increases price, the percentage fall in quantity demanded is greater and revenue falls. Revenue, however is not profit, what remains after cost of production is subtracted. If price falls when demand is elastic, revenue increases. Although costs rise too as the firm must produce more to meet higher demand. Profits only rise if the increased revenue exceeds the increased costs. Many firms cutting prices have seen profits fall when costs increased more than revenue.

Where no ambiguity exists, though, is if demand is inelastic. Increasing price must cause profits to rise. Revenue increases, as we have seen, but as demand falls, the firm produces fewer goods and so costs must fall. Rising revenue and falling costs lead to only one conclusion: profits rise.

2. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goods brought less frequently are likely to have inelastic demand. Consumers will be unaware of the price and less responsive to it. Although some goods brought infrequently can have elastic demand. Consumer durables, like televisions, are in this group. If price rises, consumers can put off buying a new set and keep their old one a little longer.

Demand might also be more elastic in the long run than in the short run. If, for example, petrol prices increase, consumers will, in the short run, continue to buy petrol as they need it for their car. To keep the car running, the consumer must pay the higher price. In time consumers can find alternatives to buying a fuel-efficient car that cuts demand for petrol. PED becomes more elastic.

For some goods, such as cigarettes, time has the opposite effect. A price rise causes a relatively large fall in quantity demanded in the short run - although in the longer run demand increases again as habit and a lack of effective substitutes become apparent to the consumer. 

Demand is elastic in the short run, although inelastic in the long run.


Income and cross-price Elasticity of demand, measures how demand responds to other changes. Economists usually do this for income and the price of other goods. The formula for these other elasticities takes the same form as that for PED.

Income elasticity of demand is defined as:

Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income

Unlike PED, economists cannot be relaxed about whether to use a plus or minus sign. With income elasticity the sign matters and we must specify it. We normally expect the sign to be positive as demand rises when income rises and falls when income falls. For inferior goods the sign will be negative given that demand falls when income rises. The sign of the income elasticity demand for a good therefore tells us if the good is normal or inferior.

If the value of the income elasticity of demand for a good is less than +1, demand is said to be income-elastic and the good is a 'necessity'. Food is an example. If the value exceeds +1, demand is income-elastic and the good is a 'luxury'. These groups are broad, however, and are guides rather than definitive statements about a good's nature.

The response of demand for a good when the price of other goods changes, is measured by cross-price (or just cross) elasticity of demand. 

For goods X and Y, the formula is:

Percentage change in quantity demanded of good X / Percentage change in price of good Y

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods at this stage are either substitutes or complements. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be complements. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

If stock trades for $100 with a volatility of 30%, then a one standard deviation price change over the span of 1 year will raise the price to $130 or lower the price to $70.

These calculations are specifically intended to take into account all the remaining time. The difference becomes increasingly significant as expiration approaches - the final moments of the cycle represented as a fraction of the remaining days. Forward modeling should, therefore, be based on total time remaining, calculated in minutes, as a percentage of trade time..different volatility values can be used and the results compared when determining the fair value of a product. A professional bidder might, calculate volatility using different-length windows - 20 days to represent the past month and 90 days to measure an entire quarter - in addition to summative factors based on trade window. Each result would generate a different option price when plugged into this pricing model (Black-Scholes) or another..'

'..'market sectors' and the more popular approach of forming indicators - flawed for a variety of reasons, most significant of these are referenced as the "overfitting" problem. Overfitting occurs when an indicator is optimally tuned against historical data. The problem is especially severe when the data spans a limited amount of time. Almost always the case that indicators, regardless of their sophistication, will work in one time frame and not another. Markets are dynamic in the sense that they are driven by economic forces that change rapidly over time..'

..how markets determine a factor of production's income. The interaction of the supply of factors of production from households and demand for them from firms solves the problem of how the goods produced in an economy are distributed. Although the demand for labour depends on its marginal revenue product, which depends on the price at which the firm can sell the goods the labour produces. The good's price is determined by market supply and demand. Although demand in the market depends partly upon consumer incomes or wages..this is said to be the problem..

Plus, the fall of exchange rates, as goods from foreign parts become dearer for buying residents of a certain locale therefore demanding fewer of them. Their reduced demand for goods causes them to supply fewer pounds into the foreign exchange market..whether these markets take account of the stockpile &/or demand for reseller products - moreover demand for new items.

Building and Testing a Model

Long-term trade trends, suggesting the use of investment strategies normally reserved for serious investors - such as data on two year rallies, extend timeframes, observation of entry points to the purchase of stock; downward corrections etc. The focus here, is on the correlation between product lines, the fluctuation in price of product lines and the direct link between quantity, trade and the race to invest based on data from these markets.

{..in believing that consumers weigh up costs and benefits when buying a good, economists assume that consumers want to maximize their utility. This might not describe how consumers really behave but it has served economists well when analysing and predicting consumer behaviour. For this reason the idea of the rational, utility-maximizing consumer is retained in economics. The logic of this view of human behaviour is that a consumer who buys a good where the cost (price) exceeds the benefit (utility) would be irrational if they wanted to maximize utility. They could have bought another good that gave more utility than the price and increased their overall utility. The notion of how consumers decide to buy goods can be used to explain the slope of the demand curve once we add another idea: as consumers obtain more of a good they obtain less utility from each extra unit of the good. It is an idea that appeals to our own experience. Economists refer to this effect as the law of diminishing marginal utility. It states that each extra, or marginal, unit consumed of a good gives utility that diminishes or falls compared with the previous unit. The consumer's total utility is still increasing, as each marginal unit gives the consumer extra utility, but more slowly with each extra unit..}

The pattern of diminishing marginal utility only applies over a fixed period of time. On another day or week, the consumer could once again experience the higher marginal utility. Part of the proposal here is to observe each consumer's utility, either through return purchase, procurement, supply and demand or receptiveness to the requirements for use of change market advertising - aka. 'air-fix kit' audience ads.

Which may seem a vain attempt to solve the problem of 'diminishing marginal utility', by endorsing the materialistic product value - their materials / giffin goods..

'..Giffen goods are usually cheap, staple or base materials - if the prices of these rise, the consumer's ability to buy other goods, including more expensive brands is greatly affected. To deal with this problem, the consumer buys more of the Giffen good, even though its price has risen, to maintain their overall consumption. At the same time, they reduce their consumption of more expensive items..'

Employing methods such as income and cross-price elasticity of demand, which measures how demand responds to other changes. Economists usually do this for income and the price of other goods. The formula for these other elasticities takes the same form as that for PED.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Income elasticity of demand is defined as:

Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income

Unlike PED, economists cannot be relaxed about whether to use a plus or minus sign. With income elasticity the sign matters and we must specify it.

We normally expect the sign to be positive as demand rises when income rises and falls when income falls. For inferior goods the sign will be negative given that demand falls when income rises. The sign of the income elasticity demand for a good therefore tells us if the good is normal or inferior.

If the value of the income elasticity of demand for a good is less than +1, demand is said to be income-elastic and the good is a 'necessity'. Food is an example. If the value exceeds +1, demand is income-elastic and the good is a 'luxury'. These groups are broad, however, and are guides rather than definitive statements about a good's nature.

The response of demand for a good when the price of other goods changes, is measured by cross-price (or just cross) elasticity of demand. 
For goods X and Y, the formula is:

Percentage change in quantity demanded of good X / Percentage change in price of good Y

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods are substitutes. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be complements. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

Cross-elasticity of demand formally measures the relationship between the markets for different goods. We do not speculate whether tea and coffee are substitutes or bread and butter are complements. Instead, we calculate cross elasticity of demand.

'..to understand how to maximize profits, therefore we must consider what determines a firm's costs and revenues. This understanding underpins how economists analyse firms' behaviour. Economic theories of the firm also reveal that markets, might not be as perfect..in order to better determine pathways there must be a consideration for different market structures, and the outcomes they forecast. By doing this, we will see the limits of perfect markets as a way of explaining how firms behave..'

Round-up: Goals and Objectives

The following aims to objectify the short, medium and long-term goals of this development.



- To familarize self with products and procedures
- break even, start making tangible returns


- Take advantage of sector opportunities, stabalise markets, account for historic trade*
- Highlight the depreciation in certain sector products - e.g. electronic goods, providing solutions as to how best to stave stockpiling of second hand devices.

'In a supplier-bidding auction, bid prices start high and move downward in reverse-auction format as bidders interact to establish a closing price. The auction marketplace is one-sided, i.e. one buyer and many potential suppliers. Typically the products being purchased are components or materials. "Components" typically mean fabricated tangible pieces or parts that become part of assemblies of durable products. Components may typically include gears, bearings, appliance shelves or door handles. 'Materials' typically mean bulk quantities of raw materials further transformed into products.

Industrial buyers do not typically purchase one component at a time. Rather they purchase whole families of similar components. At times, components are strongly related to one another. As an example, a buyer might purchase a given plastic knob in two different colors, or might purchase a nameplate in four different languages. These parts are similar that by definition they must be purchased from the same supplier - all of the knobs made using the same mold. These items are therefore grouped to a single lot. Bidders in industrial auctions must provide unit price quotes for all line items in a lot.'

{..Time Series Correlation; data mining experiments that combine price-change information with insights gleaned from textual analysis represent a high level of sophistication. Many variations and combinations are possible. The most advanced examples involve capturing and analyzing news feeds in real time with the goal of executing trades rapidly enough to capitalize on the changes of a fast moving market. In addition to generate constant positive return across a large number of trades, by both chaining product demand and meeting shortfalls in re-requisitions / bulk purchases..}

In a bid to reduce the probability off - or avoid online industrial auctions which offer incorrect bids which upset behavior of others, creating inequality for all suboptimal results for both buyers and suppliers..Instead suggesting that advertising play a stronger dynamic role in the generation of 'Short interest' - influencing the way that stocks react to financial news..better still customising campaigns according to their market data / analysis of individual demand..}

"..Advertisements, which are far more readily recorded. Broadcasting provides something of a laboratory instance depicting phase shifts, which simulates the conditions which produce it in face-to-face communication, and enables us to record it in adequate quantities from readily available data source..

Advertising, as part of this application will endorse two key aspects;

Influencers / archive materials:





Viral advertising, strongly influenced by press advertising; which divides its categories into two parts. The familiar small-print columns of classifieds, and display advertising scattered throughout the news pages and designed to attract the reader. Much the same with 'Broadcast advertisements' which come in chunks of sound ranging from 5 to 120 seconds long. They may be gathered into 'commercial breaks', as in television or dropped singularly; in and out of sequence into the flow of radio programming. 

These are the influencers which form the foundation for the dynamics of advertising pushed to your devices, depicting activity both from and to groups.




'..deciding on the time period is part of defining the universe to which a sample strictly applies..'

'..Volatility calculations plus standard price deviations..There has been much debate over the length of a trading year and the number that should be used for volatility calculations - moreover the method used to convey up-to-date data across multiple channels. In normal trading terms, although a calendar year is 365 days long, there are actually only 252 trading days, to this end volatility calculations are made in much the same way as macro trades - calculations are based on daily closing prices, although the margins of what is an appropriate number may differ greatly on a smaller - more rapid scale; subject to sector demand. Use of forward modeling, based on total time remaining, calculated in units of time, as a percentage of total trade..is a strategy normally reserved for bulk sale / acquisition, which otherwise might prove difficult to implement on micro bids..'

'..Data mining experiments that combine price-change information with insights gleaned from textual analysis represent a high level of sophistication. Many variations and combinations are possible. The most advanced examples involve capturing and analyzing news feeds in real time with the goal of executing trades rapidly enough to capitalize on the changes of a fast moving market..'

"..the goal is a reasonable one because even highly efficient markets - those characterized by strong-form efficiency - have winners and losers. It is certainly possible to profit from trends that reliably persist for several minutes, and many event-driven market moves persist for several hours. The objective should be to raise the level of accuracy, not the level of sensitivity..

Data mining approaches that generate a large number of triggers often fail when the probability of being right is just slightly greater than the probability of being wrong. A much better approach is to select stringent conditions that generate a small number of very accurate trade triggers. Many successful investors have developed systems that generate just a few triggers each year that each have very high probability of success. Option traders can capitalize on this level of accuracy by doubling or tripling their investment in a brief period of time.

Critics of this philosophy will be quick to point out that a strategy that is right 55% of the time should generate a constant positive return across a large number of trades. Unfortunately, this approach does not fully comprehend the realities of trading. An unreliable trigger must be managed with very sensitive stop orders* that limit profit even when the trigger works. Reducing the sensitivity of stop orders allows wider price fluctuations that are beneficial when a trade is moving in the profitable direction.

However increased tolerance to price fluctuations also causes larger losses when the market moves against a trade. Bid-ask spreads further complicate the situation. If we eliminate stop orders althogether, we are making the assumption that positive and negative moves have the same magnitude, and that our 55/45 advantage will generate a profit simply because we are right more often than wrong..it is very difficult to profit from a small statistical advantage.."

*. Substitution effect and its occurance because a goods price changes relative to that of other goods. If its price falls, the consumer buys more as it has become relatively cheaper. If price were to rise and the good becomes relatively dearer, the consumer substitutes another good. Citing also the change in good's price which affects a consumer's real income or total amount of goods that the consumer can buy. Price rise, the consumer's demand for all goods is affected - as derived income declines.   

- derived income is value to market of products after 'PED'.

- What realistic, measurable and stretching marketing goals do you think your business can achieve on a sustainable basis?



To re-iterate: 



'..percentage of expected sales revenue to be spent on marketing must be in proportion to trade interests and transactions. This should directly impact on the proposed marketing methods, plus the extent to which these methods are expected to reach individuals or target bases..'



- Macro / Micro markets and options trade are good indicators of this increment. 



- Endorse shared concern of individual or target customer types. In a digital republic, dependent on the scale of trade dictate req's within that sector.



- Show how time is released, through the reduction of time spent on project campaigns.

"..an aspect of the production / reception issue is deciding whether to treat each outlet equally or to weight them by audience size. If each is represented equally, it is on the grounds that each is a separate producer of language. If outlets are weighted according to their audiences, the number of receivers is treated as the important factor in selection. Not least due to determiners which create those ratios which are able to be measured against population in the area, their receptiveness to change; is again a determiner as to investment - popularity of product, receptive uptake and active competition. [z][y].." 


{'..In sociolinguistics there is also a phenomenon known as initiative or metaphorical style. This occurs when a person adopts a style, or even a language, which is not just a response to the situation as something different. This occurs, for example, when a speaker switches from local dialect to prestigious national dialect in order to win an argument with a friend or family member..data on such switches is difficult to collect, since by definition they occur rarely and in unexpected circumstances..'

}

- this application works within the confines of an existing infrastructure, allowing it to integrate with recognised frameworks adapting to markets.

'..the requirement to influence the audience through language, within a short timeframe - is another draw of application. Enabling greater cause and substantiation for shift in initiative, simulating the conditions produced in face-to-face communication - recorded in adequate quantities from readily available data sources..dealing with tangible products and their trade..'




- in much the same way, the production of langauge - composed and edited by journalists, written discourse can provide data for 'diachronic linguistics' the study of language change..more prevalent in web / multi-media..here applied to the study of changing markets.

Capital put in by owners / groups is to be kept to a minimum, advertising used to boost demand on selected products is to be substantiated with guarantees on returns - polling statistical data based on live sales. This system is to help calculate 'shortfall' and required income on reduced amounts month on month; additional potential earnings are to be calculated from forecasts and spending. Initially launched as a dry-run, polling receptive response from a buyers and sellers alike; as to their uptake of product bids.
