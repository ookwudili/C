Abstract
--------




"..Genre is largely a matter of defining what kind of copy does and does not qualify as what you or your market sector is searching for. A researcher may wish to look only at certain subgenres such as 'spot' news, features or headlines, or at certain topics such as industrial, economic or international news, or take only the front page. Defining what stories are about a particular topic provides its own set of questions.."



Based on theory, it is to be proven that revenue exists to be made from the observation and dialogue of the communicator, sourcing valid research that trade warrants proportional representation in the form of advertising and vice-versa speculation that advertising fuels trade in equal proportion as part of strategic delivery. 



Whether pitching or bidding for a window in the market, use of language markers are part and parcel of preparation which define active subject, inform strategies and offer directives as to opportunities and a base from which to develop frameworks for trade which would be of advantage to all parties. 

With this regard, in the early stages the development is to build on existing frameworks / api's hosted through established vendors. Focus remains on the synthesis of ideas in communication, using joined up thinking which form convincing messages based on statistical data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Illustrated in the following extract from a larger project along the same lines;



'..According to the Government’s most recent Communications Plan, which outlined the budget for 2013 / 2014, the closure of the COI and the spending freeze on all unnecessary marketing activities implemented across the public sector has so far resulted in efficiencies of £40m since the last General Election. The Plan also stated that spending on communications would remain much lower than it was in 2009/2010 — when it stood at £532m — with the total marketing budget for 2013/2014 estimated at £236.9m. In addition, the Government revealed that it had tasked its procurement service with a review and revision of all existing communication frameworks, which will be designed to provide support, guidance and tools to the new communications hubs regarding this process..'

The new frameworks will provide a number of benefits to the interior Government..

"

Which puts forward figures for the past few years, stating revision of all existing communication procurement frameworks designed to provide for 'new communications hubs' incorporated in this process.



'..the accord is the delivery of interval answers to integral questions..'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Strategy
-----------------

Much the same as recent replacement of the nine frameworks used in government procurement, the central management spend for companies offering this franchise is to be reduced, which in turn is expected to deliver individual advantage to re-sellers - who may wish to customise their trading experience.

 A reduced supply base, which aims to cut overheads and minimise storage / transit costs is expected to make it easier for communication ‘hubs’ to work strategically with suppliers,  introducing a change management framework which is alteration at given intervals in order to be of advantage to revenue streams based on product / market trends for that quarter.



Although this abstract is not directly relevant to the project at large, the interpretation of the text forms the basic foundation from which to highlight aspects of the 'standard pricing model' introduced to support regular benchmarking and delivery of continuous project improvements which aim to offer value for money throughout the trading term. Despite the efficiencies made within communication budgets, the reduction in marketing budgets across the public sector has without a doubt had a negative impact. The proposal is to source market advantage from clusters of 10 to 15 suppliers, who are either small-to medium-sized SME's or sole traders. 



'..comprehensive management information will be collected every month under the new framework, to ensure greater transparency regarding what services the Government is procuring and to help identify future savings opportunities.

Monopolistic competition
------------------------

Production of good's which differ from competitors good's. The market structure is a hybrid of monopoly and perfect competition. The monopolistic part is that firms produce goods which differ from their competitors' goods. The firm has a form of monopoly in what they produce, although their good also has close substitutes.

-- profit or losses in perfect competition

Demand for products and price elasticity..

Monopolistic competition and two contrasting features of this market structure mean the firm's demand curve slopes downward. This downward sloping could be interpreted as demand for the firm's products which are more price-elastic, due to the availability of substitutes.

Price elasiticity of supply
---------------------------

The supply curve in perfect competition allows us to estimate price elasticity of supply. This tells us how firms respond to changes in price and matches the price elasticity of demand identified for consumers.

formula; percentage change in quantity supplied / percentage change in price

-- maximizing profits - production of marginal costs which equals marginal revenue..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------ abstract ----------------------------------------------------------

The profit-maximizing rule is important for economists in analysing how firms behave. Applying the cost-benefit principle, firms weigh up the costs and benefits to them of deciding whether to produce. Firms do not actually calculate their marginal cost and revenue curves, the idea allows economists to predict how firms behave when different market structures exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

..the result for calculations differs, supply curve suggest that if price rises, demand rises also. The same rules apply, though, to identifying elastic and inelastic supply. If the value exceeds +1, supply is elastic. If it is less than +1 it is inelastic.

{..monopoly can outperform competition. The monopolist might use their economic profit to invest in research and development or to buy modern, productive machines. They might achieve economic scale that could mean lower rather than higher prices for consumers..}

{..such potential benefits mean competition authorities do not automatically assume a monopoly is harmful. Instead, they look at each case on its own merits, weigh up the costs and benefits, and decide whether or not they wish to act to stop a monopoly being created or to undo an existing one. It is the cost-benefit principle again..}

{..similarly, monopolies protected by the law of patents (the sole right to produce a good) give firms an incentive to develop new products that will earn economic profit. Although, where the law allows this, the monopoly is not permanent. It normally lasts only for a fixed period. In the European Union this period is 20 years, which reflects economic thinking that a monopoly might be justified for a period, although in the longer run the inefficiency caused outweighs the benefits of the monopolists innovation..}

{..difficulty with controlling monopoly is that just because an industry only has one firm, it does not necessarily mean that it is a monopoly. In contestable markets, which have a single firm, the firm must keep the same prices as in perfect competition because there are no barriers to entry, information is perfect, and there are no sunk costs. The latter costs refer to capital that can only be used in one industry. Given these circumstances, if the firm increased its prices to earn economic profit, new firms would enter the industry and undercut the existing firm. Profits become losses and either the original firm or the new entrants leave the industry..}

- anti-trust policy, as competition policy is known there, has the same goal of controlling monopolies..

Description
-----------





The proposal is to adopt an Agile project framework, which analyses essential components including; concept, planning, prototyping and development around product and sector.

Each applying:



- skills and application of concrete experiences

-- distinguished terms:
competition on price, speed, quality and correlation using purchase, trade histories, income, requirement - in particular, how product / service is to be molded and delivered by you to others, by others to you or improved upon by the supplier.



- aptitude as to what economic and statistical information to source*

-- trend data



- supply turnaround, observing fiscal trends

-- emerging micro / macro markets

Questions from a changing market sector.

"..Analysing audience and goal, especially helpful in creation of a business roadmap. The objective might be to raise capital, therefore asking yourself what readers, investors demand to know; your overall plan should answer those questions in part..”



'..Income above that needed to keep a factor of production in its current use is called rent, which might seem confusing, given rent also refers to the return landowners receive. This usage among economists, introduced by David Ricardo (1772 - 1823), occurs because early economists thought the rent received by landowners with the best land was all a surplus the landowners did not require. Rent simply resulted from increased demand for land as the economy developed and landowners did not need it. This surplus was thought to apply only to land. Although later economists realized that the same could be said for other factors in limited supply, such as certain types of labour. The term rent was therefore applied to the surplus earnings of all factors. Economic rent raises the possiblity that a government could tax a factor's economic rent without it affecting the factor's supply - this could be applied to other factors of production / earnings based on the context within which those earnings are received / subsidised..'

------------------------------------------------ abstract ----------------------------------------------------------


Economic rent and transfer earnings
-----------------------------------

Economists divide factor rewards into two components. The first is the reward a factor requires to remain in a given form of employment or transfer earnings. For example, if an I.T. engineer will only remain in her job if she is paid £600 per week, this is her transfer earnings. If she does not earn this, she will transfer to other work. It depends on her potential earnings in her next best alternative employment. If she could only earn £450 per week in I.T. she could switch to this alternate career and earn £600 per week doing that.

Suppose, however, that she was actually paid £800 per week. This income clearly exceeds what she requires to stay in the job. The xtra she receives (£200) is her economic rent, or just her rent as economists often say.

A firm's economic profit is also economic rent for the factor enterprise. The firm does not need it to remain in the industry. For that, it just requires normal profit, which is its transfer earnings.

Reference also; how factor earnings are divided between economic rent and transfer earnings in the labour market. The breakdown between the two occurs because the supply curve indicates the wage a worker requires to receive, to supply his or her labour. In each worker's transfer earnings. Although as all workers receive the equalibrium wage the difference between that wage and what they would be prepared to work for is economic rent. The only worker who receives no economic rent is the last, or marginal, worker who comes into the market attracted by the equalibrium wage. Most workers therefore receive some economic rent.

------------------------------------------------ abstract ----------------------------------------------------------


Oligopoly
---------

In oligopoly, for example, if a firm cuts its prices and the other firms react by doing the same, the price change is unlikely to affect the firm's demand and will only reduce profits. Although if the other firms do not cut their prices, the firm could make higher profits. Uncertainty about how competitors will react makes it hard to predict the effect a firm's decisions will have.

Analysis using game theory usually leads to the conclusion that firms in oligopoly will all charge the same price and keep that price stable. Provided all make normal profits (or better), firms have no incentive to change price and output as the risks of doing this are great. A lower price might spark a 'price war' that leaves everybody worse off. The firms are in a Nash equilibrium where every firm is doing the best it can, given the pricing and output strategies of the other.

The outcome with a Nash equilibrium corresponds to firms' behaviour in real oligopolies. Prices and out tend to remain constant over time. Price wars between firms occur rarely and, like geologists find with earthquakes, are hard for economists to predict and difficult to explain. In short, economists essentially describe an oligopoly's behaviour in real markets.

Claims
------

'..Turn-of-mouth return patterns are constantly subject to change because they depend on highly variable market microstructure..as consumers obtain more of a good they obtain less utility from each extra unit of the good. The effect is the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that for each extra, or marginal unit consumed of a good - gives utility that diminishes or falls compared with the previous unit. Consumers total utility is still increasing, as each marginal unit gives the consumer extra utility, at a slower pace with each extra unit. This pattern of diminishing marginal utility only applies over a fixed period of time. On another day or week, the consumer could once again experience the higher marginal utility..'

Merit goods are those for which consumer demand does not fully reflect consumer benefits. The market will undersupply merit goods either because those who would benefit from them will now realize this or, if they do, their demand would be ineffective. In this instance, inviting the market and its producers to provide the education and legacy support for / through resellers. Staving off introduction of 'demerit goods' and their over consumption, which is said to be bad for the sector. Instead quantifying demand based on the endorsement of reseller support programmes, and the under-supply of product releases - in a bid to regulate consumerism.

------------------------------------------------ abstract ----------------------------------------------------------


Income and cross-price Elasticity of demand
-------------------------------------------

Measuring how demand responds to other changes. Economists usually do this for income and the price of other goods. The formula for these other elasticities takes the same form as that for PED.

Income elasticity of demand is defined as:

Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income

Unlike PED, economists cannot be relaxed about whether to use a plus or minus sign. With income elasticity the sign matters and we must specify it.

We normally expect the sign to be positive as demand rises when income rises and falls when income falls. For inferior goods the sign will be negative given that demand falls when income rises. The sign of the income elasticity demand for a good therefore tells us if the good is normal or inferior.

If the value of the income elasticity of demand for a good is less than +1, demand is said to be income-elastic and the good is a 'necessity'. Food is an example. If the value exceeds +1, demand is income-elastic and the good is a 'luxury'. These groups are broad, however, and are guides rather than definitive statements about a good's nature.

The response of demand for a good when the price of other goods changes, is measured by cross-price (or just cross) elasticity of demand.

For goods X and Y, the formula is:

Percentage change in quantity demanded of good X / Percentage change in price of good Y

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods are substitutes. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be compliments. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

Cross-elasticity of demand formally measures the relationship between the markets for different goods. We do not speculate whether tea and coffee are substitutes or bread and butter are complements. Instead, we calculate cross elasticity of demand.

There is a justification for guiding consumerists
-------------------------------------------------

Some economists have a problem with the idea of merit and demerit goods. It suggests that consumers do not know what is good for them. Economic market theory assumes that consumers do know this and are rational in wanting to maximize the utility they obtain from consuming goods. Suggesting that consumers do not know what is best for them undermines this principle.

It is said to be difficult to decide what merits - merit goods. The danger is that any good can be described as a merit good..a case could be made that merit goods remain an under supplied, re-orderable subsidie guided by market demand. Regulation, should be used to avoid over provision through adverse selection for/from key sectors which underpin or are part of the infrastructure - education, work, healthcare and entertainment. Asymmetric Information, market failure and the cost of correcting asymmetric information, is said to arise if either consumers or producers have unequal knowledge of their sector. 

'..the market will fail as information is no longer perfect and those with extra information can exploit their advantage, this should present no problem if the wishes of the consumer are actively / accurately reflected by the producer - moreover how preferences of the shopper could better be turned into actionable returns for either reseller products or new brands..'

'..under existing circumstances, consumers do not have the information to make choices that reflect their own utility while producers exploit the asymmetry of information..' - no longer do consumers make choices that reflect their own preferences instead, producers determine demand..'

- no problem if the wishes of the consumer are actively / accurately reflected by the producer, moreover how preferences of the shopper could better be turned into actionable returns for either reseller products or new brands. Through real world consideration of markets and their fluctuation..*reference (potential) - utilisation of products both past, present and future as a reseller point of barter / sale.

------------------------------------------------ abstract ----------------------------------------------------------

'..if we combine income and substitution effects, when prices rise demand normally falls. Both substitution and income effects cause demand to fall. This result is consistent with a downward-sloping demand curve..Mostly, the substitution effect of a price rise, which causes demand to fall, exceeds the income effect that causes demand to rise. When price rises, therefore, demand usually falls. But if the income effect exceeds the substitution effect a higher price causes demand to rise, as happens with Giffen goods, which are particular types of inferior goods. If their price rises, real income declines greatly because a Giffen good comprises a large part of the consumer's spending. The large income effect exceeds the substitution effect..'

Note: money's great virtue is that it solves the problem of the double coincidence of wants associated with barter. It does this because whatever serves as money is acceptable to everybody when goods are traded. Money must have this quality of universal acceptability or it cannot be an alternative to barter.

The initial idea focuses on change marketing, guiding the market on the acquisition of products. Informing them as to when is a good time to sell, bid or swap goods* - their market worth and the receptiveness of stockists, auditors and distributors. Moreover, as to which industry sectors will be buying based on the outlook of local economies - with the objective of presenting information in the interest of the buying public.

'..barter, which is said to be far less efficient, although protects those wishing to exchange goods from losses caused by inflation..'

..the process itself could be used to accessorise on those components which created inflation, seeking to capitalise on assets which remain in demand and cashing in on liabilities..

'..price stability occurs when average prices in the economy remain constant. The average price level is measured using an index based on the prices of goods consumed. Each good's price is given a starting value for the index of 100 at a certain date. As prices change, the index number changes with them. For example, if prices rise by 10% the index rises from its starting point of 100 to 110. The index number of each good is combined in a weighted average that depends on how important each good is in total spending. The resulting average index is the measured average price level for the economy. The percentage rate at which it changes is the inflation rate..'

Two common price indices in the UK are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price Index (RPI). Both measure inflation, although the CPI is quoted more nowadays because it is consistent with inflation measures used in other European countries. This makes it useful for comparing inflation rates between countries.


Pathways
--------

- proposing an index number for the reduction in value of reseller goods..giving an indication of how fast consumer goods depreciate therefore alleviating requirement for the stockpiling. In particular examining information and its use as a tradeable commodity in the exchange, advancement and building of business links.

Rising interest rates make borrowing money more expensive and the demand for loans falls; falling rates causes the demand for loans to rise as borrowing becomes cheaper. Citing, it is the standard demand relationship applied to loans.

Although, two questions arise;

- How does the central bank change interest rates?

- Why does it not simply tell the banks to restrict their lending, based on success factors of project / product sale?

Economists define liquidity of an asset by whether it can be turned into money with certainty, without delay, and at no cost. If all three apply, the asset is liquid. If not, the asset is illiquid - citing the index number on price reduction of reseller items from same brand goods in both home and foreign markets.

'..liquidity means that defining money becomes difficult. If money is an asset that is liquid, an asset that is not directly acceptable for settling a debt although could be easily changed into money, becomes as good as money. For instance, if the liquidity of, say, a current account in a bank, which is money, differs little from a savings account in a building society, we could perphaps define both as money..'

In part, suggesting this could some how help stave off interest rates on borrowing or inflation, either meeting demand for buy-in of new goods or covering debts on loss of sale for reseller items. Noting, inflation causes money to lose value. Those holding money (cash, bank accounts, or other financial assets including savings) will be worse off. Money's function as a store of value is undermined. Those with debts, though, gain. The real value of their debt falls.

- Building a selling point

-------------------------------------------------- reference ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Citing: Additional consideration, as to how the reseller item was used and its potential application within that trade sector. Accounting for firms total costs are also the costs of different factors of production - land labour, capital and enterprise. The rewards each of these receives, rent, wages, interest and profit respectively, are, for the firm, the cost of producing / encouraging the production of goods utilising the same brand reseller item must be equated in the bid to sell. 

Ideally a selling point able to cover three sectors: primary, secondary and tertiary - moreover, equally justifying campaigns across all three.

The primary sector contains agriculture and extractive industries such as mining for ores and minerals.

The secondary sector comprises manufacturing industries that produce consumer goods and capital goods, such as machinery, for other businesses.

The tertiary sector consists of service industries. These include retailing, banking, insurance, education, and personal services such as hairdressing.

The economies of poorer countries tend to be dominated by the primary sector. As the economy grows, the secondary sector becomes more important, and then the tertiary. In rich economies, such as the US and those of Europe, the tertiary sector is generally the largest.

{..a cost that looks unusual to the non-economist is the profit paid to the factor enterprise or the entrepreneur. After all, we defined profits earlier as the amount left over once costs of production were paid out of revenue. Although economists include in production costs an element that goes to the entrepreneur. This is called normal profit and is that necessary to keep an entrepreneur in the industry in which he or she is working..}

-------------------------------------------------- reference ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Maximizing profits
------------------

Firms maximize profits at the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost; marginal revenue - revenue from last or extra unit sold of good.

If revenue from selling an extra car exceeds the cost of producing it, the firm's profits rise. In making its decision, the firm only considers variable costs, which is the marginal cost. In the short run it cannot alter fixed costs; these must be paid. Similarly, the firm only considers the extra or marginal revenue it receives from selling the car - not the justification for making it.*

Once marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue the firm stops selling cars. If it did not, profits would fall. To maximize profits, therefore, the firm produces where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The firm makes a profit on the final unit of output where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, as marginal cost includes normal profit.

- strategising re-sale, in order to maximize on profits. If manufacturers where to adopt this form of production for new goods, continuation of stock lines may be subject to undercutting by resellers who have chosen to stockpile items until conditions dictated demand and viable re-sales where able to be made.

cite: dis-continuation, modification, stockpiling and resale..ways in which marginal cost is decreased in order to meet marginal revenue.

The profit-maximizing rule is important for economists in analysing how firms behave. Applying the cost-benefit principle, firms weigh up the costs and benefits to them of deciding whether to produce. Firms do not actually calculate their marginal cost and revenue curves, the idea allows economists to predict how firms behave when different market structures exist.

Cite: 'perfect market concept', enabling economists to predict reasonably well upon which foundations firms are likely to behave when different market structures exist and suggest policy ideas or changes based on fair competition. The case against monopoly is that it does not deliver the most efficient output. Policymakers have accepted this economic analysis and created laws and structures called competition policy that limit firms from becoming and remaining monopolists. In the UK, THE Competition Commission enforces legislation and is legally obliged to encourage competition and to discourage practices that restrict competition and lead to monopoly. Similar arrangements for competition exist in the European Union, which also affects UK firms. In the United States, anti-trust policy, as competition policy is known there, has the same goal of controlling monopolies.

The suggestion is that, through negotiation it is in part left up to the buyer / sellers to equate factors of success against own efforts.

Barter, and its role in reseller economies
------------------------------------------

..fixed money incomes, negotiation of inflation-matching wage increases and maintaining real incomes plus inflation and its affect on the redistribution of income and wealth, whether monopolising in periods of rising inflation which cause money to lose value, is a determiner in this instance on the undermining of money's function as a store of value. Those with debts, may stand to gain as the real value of their debt falls, encouraging affiliate resellers to take on more trade or take cuts on the value of goods to make sales through dwindling periods.

Citing: The implementation of cash and bank deposits or 'fungible deposits' which could either be fed into a form of 'fractional reserve banking' or used to give greater ability; as third parties seek to make loans and interest rates or impose quantitative controls. When operating normally, banks are intermediaries between borrowers and lenders. They take money from lenders and pass it on to borrowers, this could be financed by the producers of the product. As the process advocates the exclusion of bank's, in their role as intermediary - a process known as 'disintermediation'.

In this sense, more emphasis is on making use of reserves - whilst in agreement that returns are to be made for endorsement of reseller brands. Using a sort of 'credit multiplier' systems, where lending is made by the proportion of deposits cashed on any day. Making the argument that ultimately debt must be repaid, stating that the marginal decline in product value is a reduction on income in the circular flow - although the devaluation of selected items may increase income in the short term, dependent on how the buyer and seller market is played. Whether the rule surrounding spend, investment and supply are subject to change, based on the form in which savings are added - eg. cheque, debit or cash payment, moreover - the advantage this might serve in the delivery service over this period remains to be seen. 

Although, essentially the objectives remain the same - searching for the 'liquidity' of an asset by whether it can be turned into money with certainty, without delay, and at no cost. Releasing the value of items, based on the moves the company continues to make plus legacy support for product ranges - boosted by strategies to compliment their place in a buyers market. Whether thats the current, currency value of imported reseller items, against the value of popular goods from countries with better economies.

The credit multiplier
---------------------

Bank lending is limited by the proportion of deposits that customers want to cash on any day. If the bank think customers only want 10%, for every £1 of cash deposited, the bank could make £9 of loans. The bank's total assets would be £10(£1 cash + £9 loans) as would its liabilities (the deposits). The bank would have enough cash to meet their customers' requirements.

Rising interest rates make borrowing money more expensive and the demand for loans falls; falling rates causes the demand for loans to rise as borrowing becomes cheaper. Reference; it is the standard demand relationship applied to loans.

Two questions arise. How does the central bank change interest rate? And why does it not simply tell the banks to restrict their lending?

If money loses any of these qualities it becomes undesirable and anybody holding it will want to dispose of it as quickly as possible. This is Gresham's Law that 'bad money drives out good', a law often observed when a person receives a foreign coin in their change.

Running shop, savings and investments..

Inflation's effect on the value of financial assets does not necessarily mean, though, that savings fall when inflation rises. The uncertianty that inflation brings can cause households to save more if they fear for the future and wish to maintain the real value of their savings. Households might defer consumption if they think price rises by individual firms are not inflationary but profiteering. It takes them time to discover that all firms have increased their prices. In the meantime, savings rise. These effects were evident in the UK economy in 1975. Inflation was 25% and interest rates were 15% although savings still rose.

..competition and natural monopoly:

A special case of monopoly is natural monopoly in which the marginal cost of production is always falling. This occurs in utility industries such as gas, electricity and water that require large investments into their infrastructure - piping, cables etc. In order to supply the product to consumers. The fixed cost involved in setting up the industry are high - although once the network is in place, the marginal cost of supplying the product becomes progressively lower.

..market structure which can differ from economist's ideal of perfect competition. Markets with monopolistic competition, oligopoly, or monopoly generate outputs below that in perfect competition. As output in a perfect market is Pareto-efficient, imperfect competition is likely to lead to market failure. It is possible firms will produce the perfectly competitive output, only if they are not profit-maximizers..

note: slashing the cost of putting in place industries, including the steady reduction in marginal costs of supply and/or consumption, demand and supply (the later normally used for second-hand goods). The cost of establising the network is also a barrier to entry for new firms. They face high costs that they would have to recoup and would find it difficult to compete on price with existing firms. The problems for new entrants mean the monopoly is likely to persist. In cases such as this, one producer is enough and so the monopoly is 'natural'.

'..Public provision of health and education can address market failures due to external benefits and can help to counter possible consequences of asymmetric information, as in health care. Governments also provide directly public goods such as defence, police and the coastguard, and quasi-public goods like roads..'

Public provision does not mean, however, that it has to be produced by the public sector. The use of tax revenue to pay privately for production of goods is normally a provision saved for use by government departments.

They use tax revenue to pay private producers to produce the goods, the suggestion here is that they also pay provision to resellers.

Public provision production of private goods..

The government sets the framework and ensures a good is free to users, even though the provider is a private sector firm. They do this because a private firm, with profits in mind, has an incentive to be efficient. In contrast, a public provider with no profit motive can suffer from X-inefficiency. 

'..macroeconomic ideas have caused economists to emphasize the government's role in ensuring an economy's stability. This view matches the focus, which pointed to how a government can involve itself in individual markets to improve how they operate..' 

Reaching states of equilibrium, where the flow remains at a particular income and rate of expenditure - as when an individual market is in equilibrium at the point when supply equals demand and there exists additional trade off's from the old economy. In addition there should be two major conditions of remaining in equilibrium at a fixed income rules / conditions of change inclusive to demand.

The adverse effects of savings can be offset as spending enters a circular flow elsewhere. In the simple economy, this happens when firms devote some of their spending to the goods of other firms and not the factor services of sectors - usually the case with the buying in of capital goods. Predicting the circular flow, from what remains at a particular income or level of purchasing power.

Income and wealth
-----------------

Unlike income, wealth is rarely measured. The practical difficulties of measuring the value of every asset in an economy at a given date are immense and would be attempted in the knowledge that the very next day the value would have changed.

'..the economy maintains a constant income and is in equilibrium when savings (the withdrawal) equal investment (the injection). The downward effect savings can have on income is offset by the injection of extra income into the circular flow when firms invest. This economy can remain in equilibrium as long as savings and investment remain unchanged..'

This is depreciation. The cost of depreciation should, in theory, be deducted from the value of output produced to reflect the lost value of capital. If this happened, Net, and not Gross, Domestic Product would be obtained. In practice, calculating depreciation is difficult and likely to be inaccurate. Economists prefer to rely on GDP as the measure of national income even though, strictly speaking, they should use Net Domestic Product.

Economists use elasticity to identify how much demand responds to changes in any of the factors that explain demand. Large changes are elastic. Demand changes readily. Small changes are inelastic just as steel wires respond little when pulled. Factors of elasticity, identified include how much demand responds to change in any of the factors. As price and quantity demanded are both elements in the PED formula, a firm can establish how changing the price of its good affects revenue if it knows the PED of its goods.

For example, when demand is price-inelastic, increasing price cuts demand, but the fall is less in percentage terms than the price rise. Mathematically, revenue must rise. If demand is elastic, though, and the firm increases price, the percentage fall in quantity demanded is greater and revenue falls.

Revenue, however is not profit, what remains after cost of production is subtracted. If price falls when demand is elastic, revenue increases. Although costs rise too as the firm must produce more to meet higher demand. Profits only rise if the increased revenue exceeds the increased costs. Many firms cutting prices have seen profits fall when costs increased more than revenue.

Where no ambiguity exists, though, is if demand is inelastic. Increasing price must cause profits to rise. Revenue increases, as we have seen, but as demand falls, the firm produces fewer goods and so costs must fall. Rising revenue and falling costs lead to only one conclusion: profits rise.

The good's price is determined by market supply and demand. Although demand in the market depends partly upon consumer incomes or wages..this is said to be the problem..

Goods brought less frequently are likely to have inelastic demand. Consumers will be unaware of the price and less responsive to it. Although some goods brought infrequently can have elastic demand.

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods at this stage are either substitutes or complements. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be compliments. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

Consumer durables, like televisions, are in this group. If price rises, consumers can put off buying a new set and keep their old one a little longer.

Demand might also be more elastic in the long run than in the short run. If, for example, petrol prices increase, consumers will, in the short run, continue to buy petrol as they need it for their car. To keep the car running, the consumer must pay the higher price. In time consumers can find alternatives to buying a fuel-efficient car that cuts demand for petrol. PED becomes more elastic.

For some goods, such as cigarettes, time has the opposite effect. A price rise causes a relatively large fall in quantity demanded in the short run - although in the longer run demand increases again as habit and a lack of effective substitutes become apparent to the consumer. 

Demand is elastic in the short run, although inelastic in the long run.

Income and cross-price Elasticity of demand, measures how demand responds to other changes. Economists usually do this for income and the price of other goods. The formula for these other elasticities takes the same form as that for PED.

Income elasticity of demand is defined as:

Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income

Unlike PED, economists cannot be relaxed about whether to use a plus or minus sign. With income elasticity the sign matters and we must specify it. We normally expect the sign to be positive as demand rises when income rises and falls when income falls. For inferior goods the sign will be negative given that demand falls when income rises. The sign of the income elasticity demand for a good therefore tells us if the good is normal or inferior.

If the value of the income elasticity of demand for a good is less than +1, demand is said to be income-elastic and the good is a 'necessity'. Food is an example. If the value exceeds +1, demand is income-elastic and the good is a 'luxury'. These groups are broad, however, and are guides rather than definitive statements about a good's nature.

The response of demand for a good when the price of other goods changes, is measured by cross-price (or just cross) elasticity of demand. 

For goods X and Y, the formula is:

Percentage change in quantity demanded of good X / Percentage change in price of good Y

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods at this stage are either substitutes or complements. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be compliments. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

If stock trades for $100 with a volatility of 30%, then a one standard deviation price change over the span of 1 year will raise the price to $130 or lower the price to $70.

Forward modeling should, therefore, be based on total time remaining, calculated in minutes, as a percentage of trade time..different volatility values can be used and the results compared when determining the fair value of a product. A professional bidder might, calculate volatility using different-length windows - 20 days to represent the past month and 90 days to measure an entire quarter - in addition to summative factors based on trade window. Each result would generate a different option price when plugged into this pricing model (Black-Scholes) or another..'

{..in believing that consumers weigh up costs and benefits when buying a good, economists assume that consumers want to maximize their utility. This might not describe how consumers really behave but it has served economists well when analysing and predicting consumer behaviour. For this reason the idea of the rational, utility-maximizing consumer is retained in economics. The logic of this view of human behaviour is that a consumer who buys a good where the cost (price) exceeds the benefit (utility) would be irrational if they wanted to maximize utility. They could have bought another good that gave more utility than the price and increased their overall utility. The notion of how consumers decide to buy goods can be used to explain the slope of the demand curve once we add another idea: as consumers obtain more of a good they obtain less utility from each extra unit of the good. It is an idea that appeals to our own experience. Economists refer to this effect as the law of diminishing marginal utility. It states that each extra, or marginal, unit consumed of a good gives utility that diminishes or falls compared with the previous unit. The consumer's total utility is still increasing, as each marginal unit gives the consumer extra utility, but more slowly with each extra unit..}

Cite: reseller advantage, in offering half price deals on new releases, using foundation research and opinion of consumers as to ideals and their return in utility..

----------------------------------------------------- reference ---------------------------------------------------------

The pattern of diminishing marginal utility only applies over a fixed period of time. On another day or week, the consumer could once again experience the higher marginal utility. Part of the proposal here is to observe each consumer's utility, either through return purchase, procurement, supply and demand or receptiveness to the requirements for use of change market advertising - aka. 'air-fix kit' audience ads.

Which may seem a vain attempt to solve the problem of 'diminishing marginal utility', by endorsing the materialistic product value.

Employing methods such as income and cross-price elasticity of demand, which measures how demand responds to other changes. Economists usually do this for income and the price of other goods. The formula for these other elasticities takes the same form as that for PED.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Income elasticity of demand is defined as:

Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in income

Unlike PED, economists cannot be relaxed about whether to use a plus or minus sign. With income elasticity the sign matters and we must specify it.

We normally expect the sign to be positive as demand rises when income rises and falls when income falls. For inferior goods the sign will be negative given that demand falls when income rises. The sign of the income elasticity demand for a good therefore tells us if the good is normal or inferior.

If the value of the income elasticity of demand for a good is less than +1, demand is said to be income-elastic and the good is a 'necessity'. Food is an example. If the value exceeds +1, demand is income-elastic and the good is a 'luxury'. These groups are broad, however, and are guides rather than definitive statements about a good's nature.

The response of demand for a good when the price of other goods changes, is measured by cross-price (or just cross) elasticity of demand. 

For goods X and Y, the formula is:

Percentage change in quantity demanded of good X / Percentage change in price of good Y

As with income elasticity, the sign for cross-elasticity matters. A positive sign means good Y's higher price has caused demand for good X to increase. This implies the two goods are substitutes. If the sign is negative, and demand for X fell, when the price of Y rose, the goods must be complements. And if the demand for X does not change, the two goods are independent of each other.

Cross-elasticity of demand formally measures the relationship between the markets for different goods. We do not speculate whether tea and coffee are substitutes or bread and butter are complements. Instead, we calculate cross elasticity of demand.

By doing this, we will see the limits of perfect markets as a way of explaining how firms behave..'

*account of historic trade

'In a supplier-bidding auction, bid prices start high and move downward in reverse-auction format as bidders interact to establish a closing price. The auction marketplace is one-sided, i.e. one buyer and many potential suppliers. Typically the products being purchased are components or materials. "Components" typically mean fabricated tangible pieces or parts that become part of assemblies of durable products. Components may typically include gears, bearings, appliance shelves or door handles. 'Materials' typically mean bulk quantities of raw materials further transformed into products.

Industrial buyers do not typically purchase one component at a time. Rather they purchase whole families of similar components, services are seen as a requirement to be called upon only when needed. At times, components are strongly related to one another. As an example, a buyer might purchase a given plastic knob in two different colors, or might purchase a nameplate in four different languages. These parts are similar that by definition they must be purchased from the same supplier - all of the knobs made using the same mold. These items are therefore grouped to a single lot. Bidders in industrial auctions must provide unit price quotes for all line items in a lot.'

"..the goal is a reasonable one because even highly efficient markets - those characterized by strong-form efficiency - have winners and losers. It is certainly possible to profit from trends that reliably persist for several minutes, and many event-driven market moves persist for several hours. The objective should be to raise the level of accuracy, not the level of sensitivity.."

Data mining approaches that generate a large number of triggers often fail when the probability of being right is just slightly greater than the probability of being wrong. A much better approach is to select stringent conditions that generate a small number of very accurate trade triggers. Many successful investors have developed systems that generate just a few triggers each year that each have very high probability of success. Option traders can capitalize on this level of accuracy by doubling or tripling their investment in a brief period of time.

Critics of this philosophy will be quick to point out that a strategy that is right 55% of the time should generate a constant positive return across a large number of trades. Unfortunately, this approach does not fully comprehend the realities of trading. An unreliable trigger must be managed with very sensitive stop orders* that limit profit even when the trigger works. Reducing the sensitivity of stop orders allows wider price fluctuations that are beneficial when a trade is moving in the profitable direction.

However increased tolerance to price fluctuations also causes larger losses when the market moves against a trade. Bid-ask spreads further complicate the situation. If we eliminate stop orders althogether, we are making the assumption that positive and negative moves have the same magnitude, and that our 55/45 advantage will generate a profit simply because we are right more often than wrong..it is very difficult to profit from a small statistical advantage.."
