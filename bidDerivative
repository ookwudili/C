Abstract
--------




"..Genre is largely a matter of defining what kind of copy does and does not qualify as what you or market sector searching for. A researcher may wish to look only at certain subgenres such as 'spot' news, features or headlines, or at certain topics such as industrial, economic or international news, or take only the front page. Defining what stories are about a particular topic provides its own set of questions.."

Based on theory, not too dissimilar to essay questions or topic statements themselves a requirement to deliver on solid evidence; that revenue exists to be made from each venture based on the observation or dialogue of the communicator. It is to be proven through valid research, that trade exists to be made, warrants advertising is part of the strategic delivery of marketing campaigns.  

Whether pitching or bidding for a window in the market, use of language markers are part and parcel of preparation which define active subject, inform strategies and offer directives as to opportunities and a foundation on which to develop a framework for trade. With this regard, the development is based on existing bidding software supplied through well known vendors such as ebay, amazon plus many others.


Focus remains on the synthesis of ideas in communication, through joined up thinking which form convincing messages based on statistical data. 

Better illustrated in the following extract;



"..According to the Government’s most recent Communications Plan, which outlined the budget for 2013 / 2014, the closure of the COI and the spending freeze on all unnecessary marketing activities implemented across the public sector has so far resulted in efficiencies of £40m since the last General Election. The Plan also stated that spending on communications would remain much lower than it was in 2009/2010 — when it stood at £532m — with the total marketing budget for 2013/2014 estimated at £236.9m. In addition, the Government revealed that it had tasked its procurement service with a review and revision of all existing communication procurement frameworks, which will be designed to provide support, guidance and tools to the new communications hubs regarding the procurement process. 
The new frameworks will provide a number of benefits to the interior Government..

"

Which puts forward figures for the past few years, stating revision of all existing communication procurement frameworks designed to provide for 'new communications hubs' incorporated in this process.



'..the accord is to delivering interval answers to integral questions..'


Proposed Strategy



Replacing nine frameworks, the management spend is to be reduced, which is expected to deliver estimated savings.

 A reduced supply base is expected to make it easier for the Government’s communication ‘hubs’ to work strategically with suppliers, who will now be managed just once on behalf of the entire Government. 

(*) - 14 of the 27 suppliers are small-to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which is directly in line with the Government’s wider ambitions to support the SME sector. 

Comprehensive management information will be collected every month under the new framework, to ensure greater transparency regarding what services the Government is procuring and to help identify future savings opportunities.


These texts are cited from a government document, freely available online @ .gov.uk. Endorsing them in this document, the objective is to get a better overview of the connectives between procurement and the introduction of new frameworks; how subject they are to trend data / fluctuations in the market economy for information which in turn should form the basis for trade at any level.




Although this abstract is not directly relevant to the project at large, the interpretation of the text forms the basic foundation from which to highlight aspects of standard pricing models to be introduced to support regular benchmarking and the delivery of continuous projects with benchmarks for improvement offering value for money throughout the trading term. 
Despite the efficiencies made by the Government within its communications budget, the closure of the COI and the reduction in marketing budgets across the public sector has without a doubt had a negative impact on a number of advertising and marketing agencies located in the UK, particularly those that rely heavily on public sector contracts. (*)



(*) - Although these figures do not directly impact upon the activities of SME's, start-ups or individual ventures - it does give readers an idea of the wider issues prevalent both in this sector and across a wider spectrum.  


Description
-----------





The proposal is to adopt and Agile project framework, which analysing essential components of the project framework; planning, concept, prototype and development around product and sector markets.



Each requires ability to apply:



- skills and application of concrete experiences

-- distinguished terms:
competition on price, speed, quality and correlation using purchase history, income, requirement - in particular, how product / service is to be molded and delivered by you to others, by others to you or improved upon by the supplier.



- aptitude as to what economic and statistical information to source*

-- trend data



- supply turnaround, observing fiscal trends

-- supply and demand in emerging micro / macro 

markets



-------

"..Analysing audience and goal, especially helpful in creating business roadmap. The goal might be to raise capital, therefore asking yourself what readers, investors demand to know - your overall plan should answer those questions in part..”






Claims
------




The initial idea focuses on change marketing, guiding the market on the acquisition of products. Informing them as to when is a good time to sell, bid or swap goods - their market worth and the receptiveness of stockists, auditors, distributers. Moreover, as to which industry sectors will be buying based on the outlook of local economies - with the objective of presenting information in the interest of the buying public.

Questioning decision rules, adjusting unit price quotes at the line item level, calculating floor and ceiling on particular items within a high. Although the application protocol is just a component of a system of bids, the proposal is they remain subject to an infrastructure of change dictated by the economic sponsors. An ideal which might better endorse both past and future marketable products.

Due to the nature of derivatives, they are said to cover many types of products; their arcane markets themselves subject to change. 

The following aims to objectify the short, medium and long-term goals of this application.



- To familarize self with products and procedures
- break even, start making tangible returns


- Take advantage of sector opportunities, stabalise markets, account for historic trade*

'In a supplier-bidding auction, bid prices start high and move downward in reverse-auction format as bidders interact to establish a closing price. The auction marketplace is one-sided, i.e. one buyer and many potential suppliers. Typically the products being purchased are components or materials. "Components" typically mean fabricated tangible pieces or parts that become part of assemblies of durable products. Components may typically include gears, bearings, appliance shelves or door handles. 'Materials' typically mean bulk quantities of raw materials further transformed into product. 

Industrial buyers do not typically purchase one component at a time. Rather they purchase whole families of similar components. At times, components are strongly related to one another. As an example, a buyer might purchase a  given plastic knob in two different colors, or might purchase a nameplate in four different languages. These parts are similar that by definition they must be purchased from the same supplier - all of the knobs made using the same mold. These items are therefore grouped to a single lot. Bidders in industrial auctions must provide unit price quotes for all line items in a lot.'

* showing the practical affects of individual, group or syndicates said to be contributive to the company finances. In a bid to reduce the probability off - or avoid online industrial auctions which offer incorrect bids which upset behavior of others, creating inequality for all suboptimal results for buyers and suppliers.

"..Advertisements, which are far more readily recorded. Broadcasting provides something of a laboratory instance depicting phase shifts, which simulates the conditions which produce it in face-to-face communication, and enables us to record it in adequate quantities from readily available data source..

"

Advertising, as part of this application will endorse two key aspects;



Viral advertising, strongly influenced by press advertising; which divides its categories into two parts. The familiar small-print columns of classifieds, and display advertising scattered throughout the news pages and designed to attract the reader. Much the same with 'Broadcast advertisements' which come in chunks of sound ranging from 5 to 120 seconds long. They may be gathered into 'commercial breaks', as in television or dropped singularly; in and out of sequence into the flow of radio programming. 

These are the influencers which form the foundation for dynamics of advertising pushed to your devices, active / live alerts which have relevance to trade; both from and to groups.




'..deciding the time period is part of defining the universe to which a sample strictly applies..adversely deciding on the period is part of defining the universe to which sample strictly applies..'




The Strengths of the product should be in knowing digital goals as a bidder; understanding the market sector your trading with / to - plus knowing exactly what you want to communicate in ad. statement is said to be core. 

"..selling points, should focus on framing the right content at intersection of goal and audience. Short-form or 'one-in-four messages' say the other three forms of communication should share idea's, comments on subject.."



The rest is usually left to the discretion of the parties concerned, correlating its significance with the principles of business communications for short and long-form foundation materials.
 

Trade wallet, offering flexible inline / line-item rules which denote locked-in / fixed and variable portions of each sector. Furthermore be able to adjust rapidly to movements in the market beyond original expectations - offering alternates to product lines matching brand or alternate components to specification. *.

*. Substitution effect and its occurance because a goods price changes relative to that of other goods. If its price falls, the consumer buys more as it has become relatively cheaper. If price were to rise and the good becomes relatively dearer, the consumer substitutes another good. Citing also the change in good's price which affects a consumer's real income or total amount of goods that the consumer can buy. Price rise, the consumer's demand for all goods is affected - as derived income declines.   

- derived income is value to market of products after 'PED'.

'..campaign for change: Budget campaigns, metered against consumer demands and realistic goals..'



- What realistic, measurable and stretching marketing goals do you think your business can achieve on a sustainable basis?



To re-iterate: 



'..percentage of expected sales revenue to be spent on marketing must be in proportion to trade interests and transactions. This should directly impact on the proposed marketing methods, plus the extent to which these methods are expected to reach individuals or target bases..'



- Macro / Micro markets and options trade are good indicators of this increment. 



- Endorse shared concern of individual or target customer types. In a digital republic, dependent on the scale of trade dictate req's within that sector.



- Show how time is released, through the reduction of time spent on project campaigns.


- In the loop, passing on of circle influencers, trading customer bases aswell as products.
 How do your competitors retain customers, sharing realistic, measurable and stretching marketing goals

"..an aspect of the production / reception issue is deciding whether to treat each outlet equally or to weight them by audience size. If each is represented equally, it is on the grounds that each is a separate producer of language. If outlets are weighted according to their audiences, the number of receivers is treated as the important factor in selection. Not least due to determiners which create those ratios which are able to be measured against population in the area, their receptiveness to change; is again a determiner as to investment, active competition. [z][y].." 


'..In sociolinguistics there is also a phenomenon known as initiative or metaphorical style. This occurs when a person adopts a style, or even a language, which is not just a response to the situation as something different. This occurs, for example, when a speaker switches from local dialect to prestigious national dialect in order to win an argument with a friend or family member..data on such switches is difficult to collect, since by definition they occur rarely and in unexpected circumstances..'



- this application works within the confines of an existing infrastructure, allowing it to integrate with frameworks across the board which utilise revenue streams from recognised markets.

'..the requirement to influence the audience through language, and a short time to do it in..another instance of initiative shift, which simulates the conditions which produce it are face-to-face communication it enables us to record in adequate quantities from readily available data sources..'




- '..the instance of news production means we can gain access to langauge on the production line as it is composed and edited by journalists and written discourse, the media can provide data for diachronic linguistics - the study of language change..more prevalent in web / multi-media..'



- Proposing a sort of 'agnostic' system of analysis of users histories, bidding habits and research of their product sector - working on the premise of established pathways for success either built upon or endorsed and re-worked by third parties.


Returns
-------

Capital put in by owners / groups is to be kept to a minimum, advertising used to boost demand on selected products is to be substantiated with guarantees on returns - polling statistical data based on live sales. This system is to help calculate 'shortfall' and required income on reduced amounts month on month; additional potential earnings are to be calculated from forecasts and spending.
